  <h2>Passive View</h2>
  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html">Martin Fowler</a>
  <h4>A screen and components with all application specific behavior extracted into a controller so that the widgets have their
    state controlled entirely by controller</h4>
  <p>
    A perennial problem with building rich client systems is the complication of testing them. Most rich client frameworks were
    not built with automated testing in mind. Controlling these frameworks programaticly is often very difficult.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Passive View handles this by reducing the behavior of the UI components to the absolute minimum by using a controller that
    not just handles responses to user events, but also does all the updating of the view. This allows testing to be focused
    on the controller with little risk of problems in the view.

  <h2>Model View Controller - MVC</h2>
  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/modelViewController.html">Martin Fowler</a>
  <h4>Splits user interface interaction into three distinct roles.</h4>

  <p>
    Usually people confuse the "Model" with the business Entity. Actuall, the "Model" represents the internal state of the view-component.
    View and Controller share this internal state in a Model. Techniques like double-binding allows to comunicate both components.
    Because the controller and the view are bound to the same state - the Model. Commonly, messages between them (View and
    Controller) are sent throw the Model.
